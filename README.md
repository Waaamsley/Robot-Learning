# Robot-Learning
Machine learning for remote robot control

The work in this repository is related to my project for my Post-graduate diploma in Computer Science.

This project involves using a camera to capture an environment where a small robot will be situated along with obstacles throughtout an environment.
The robot has to navigate from a starting location to another location in the environment. An agent will learn how to pilot the robot through the environment using a camera feed of the environment.
The camera feed will be processed using opencv to allow the agent to know where obstacles and the robot are. It will not know that the obstacles are obstacles, it will learn this.
This will also allow the agent to see what happens to the robot when actions are sent.
